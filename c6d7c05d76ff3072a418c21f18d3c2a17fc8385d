      "message": "This is currently handled in soong, for glob exclusions and for replacing source files in specific architectures.  This syntax can\u0027t be entirely handled in Blueprint, because Blueprint doesn\u0027t know what is a list of source files where this syntax makes sense, and what is a list of cflags where this syntax would be disastrous.\n\nSupporting the - operator for lists is certainly possible (I added support for the + operator not that long ago), if we can figure out a syntax and behavior that makes sense.  In particular, I\u0027m worried about how to deal with per-arch overriden source files like bionic/Blueprints uses, where a property might contain only a list of sources to remove with nothing to explicitly subtract it from.  For example:\n\ncc_library{\n  srcs: [\"a.c\", \"b.c\"],\n  arch: {\n    arm: {\n      srcs: -[\"b.c\"],\n    },\n  },\n}\n\nThe negative list in arch.arm.srcs would be hard to support cleanly.",
